Building a microservice architecture where OrderService needs to communicate with another microservice called ProductService. 
We're using Spring Cloud OpenFeign for declarative REST client communication.

@EnableFeignClients: This enables Feign support, allowing the use of @FeignClient interfaces to call external services.

@FeignClient(name = "ProductService/v1/product")
This tells Spring to create a Feign proxy for communicating with another service.

However, this is incorrect usage. The name parameter should be the registered service name, e.g., ProductService.

The correct way to handle paths like /v1/product is using @RequestMapping at the interface level.
@FeignClient(name = "ProductService")
@RequestMapping("/v1/product")
public interface ProductService {
Now:
ProductService is the name registered in Eureka or configured via properties.
/v1/product/reduceQuantity/{id} is the full endpoint path that will be hit on the ProductService side.
}
